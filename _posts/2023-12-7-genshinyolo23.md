GenshinYOLO23 is my final project for my Computer Vision class. I call it GenshinYOLO because it's a YOLO model designed for real-time Genshin monster detection in Genshin Impact game scene. Basically it's just a pretrained YOLOv5s model finetuned on a custom-made Genshin monster dataset of ~1700 manually annotated images of monsters in game scene with 23 classes. Detailed information and link to my dataset and model checkpoint can be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/FrozenPeak0701/GenshinYOLO23).
