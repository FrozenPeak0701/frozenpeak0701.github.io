Hi! My name is Zeyu Ma. I am currently in the Master's program in Physics at Northwestern University. I received my B.S. in Physics (with Honors) with a second major in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.

My current research interest is in quantum many-body physics and Quantum Information related topics. My current project is studying the reduced dynamics of a probe spin weakly coupled to a 1D transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) using DMRG methods based on matrix product state representations.

My hobbies are playing chess, playing the guitar, stargazing, and playing video games. I also enjoy some casual coding and watching/performing magic tricks from time to time.
