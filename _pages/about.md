Hi! My name is Zeyu Ma. I am currently in the Master's program in Physics at Northwestern University. I received my B.S. in Physics (with Honors) with a second major in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.

My current research interests are in Condensed Matter, more specifically in Quantum Information related topics.

My hobbies are playing chess, biking, stargazing, and playing video games. I also enjoy some casual coding and watching/performing magic tricks from time to time.
